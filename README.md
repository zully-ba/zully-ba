Hello, I'm Zuliyat Usman
I am a dedicated linguistic researcher with a strong focus on experimental design and data analysis. My expertise lies in conducting linguistic experiments using OpenSesame and OSweb to investigate various facets of language and cognition. I combine this with my passion for data science, leveraging tools like R and GitHub to manage and analyze complex datasets.

My current research project, titled "Well-being Study 2024," explores the intricate relationship between vocal characteristics and psychological well-being, integrating both linguistic analysis and machine learning techniques. You can find more about the project here.

Areas of Focus:
Linguistic experimentation with OpenSesame and OSweb
Data-driven research in language and cognition
Psycholinguistics and human-computer interaction
Currently Learning:
Advanced data science methodologies
Online experiment deployment using OSweb and JATOS
